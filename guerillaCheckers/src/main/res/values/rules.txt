Pieces:

6 large Counterinsurgent (COIN) pieces, 66 small Guerrilla pieces

Moving and Capturing:

The Guerrilla player does not move his pieces. Instead, he places two and only two pieces per turn on the board, on the points (intersections) of the squares. The first piece must be orthogonally adjacent to any stone on the board; the second piece must be orthogonally adjacent to the first piece placed. He may not place pieces on the exterior board edge points (i.e. any place it is impossible for him to be captured). He captures an enemy piece by surrounding it (i.e. having a piece, or an exterior board edge point, on each of the four points of the square the piece occupies – note this makes the edge of the board very dangerous for the COIN player). He removes the piece. The COIN player either: moves one piece per turn, one square diagonally in any direction; or makes captures with one piece by jumping over the point between two squares into an empty square, removing Guerrilla pieces as he goes. He is not forced to capture if he does not want to, but if he starts capturing he must continue to make captures for as long as it is possible for him to do so, along the path he chooses. Players may not pass. Victory: The player who clears the board of all enemy pieces at the end of his turn wins. The Guerrilla player loses if he runs out of pieces.
